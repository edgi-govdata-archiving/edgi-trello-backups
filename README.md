# EDGI Trello Backups

The purpose of this git repo is to visibilize changes in Trello boards,
which by default don't have history.

For now, this is manually updated by downloading the JSON export via:

    [Trello Board] > Show Menu > More > Print and Export > Export JSON

Or alternatively, directly via this location:

    https://trello.com/b/<board-id>.json

We store these dumps in `data/<board-id>.json`.
