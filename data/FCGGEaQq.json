It's built on a service called \"Trello\". Trello is a tool for doing tasks on your own or with others. We've customized it for onboarding. \n\nFor us, the main parts of Trello are:\n\n- **boards.** This whole space you're looking at.\n- **lists.** The labelled columns.\n- **cards.** High level tasks which can be dragged between lists.\n- **checklists.** These are great for smaller tasks within cards.\n\nWe've chosen to set up our Trello board so that there are a few lists:\n\n- **To Do.** Tasks to accomplish.\n- **In Progress.** A list for longer tasks you're currently working on.\n- **Complete.** A list for dropping cards that you're done with.\n\nThe general idea is to drag cards from \"To Do\" through to \"Completed\".\n\n## Why do we do this?\n\nI bet you're asking this. As in, why don't we just use a document listing all the things to do?\n\nThat's a great question! \n\nBasically, we feel that this approach makes onboarding a more active and self-directed process. It also helps improve remote onboarding, which sometimes suffers compared to the personal in-person experience.\n\nFor example, with this workflow, a newcomer who needs help 3 days after arriving in the community, can drop a link to their personal Trello board into chat. A mature contributor (even if this is their first interaction with this person in their onboarding journey) can understand the _state of the newcomer's understanding_ -- what they know and where they are. The mature contributor is then better able to assist, without sussing out the answers to a whole ton of subtle questions about what the newcomer knows!
